# Summer 2024 Project

## Description
This project is designed by Jianying Wang as a summer project for William Teng, a rising 9th grader.

This is a live-document subject to constant revision as we progress through the project.

The "Instruction" section contains step-by-step guide to be provided by Jianying.

The "Project Contents" section will be maintained and updated by William to document various tasks 
he completes.

## Instruction

The overall goal of this project is for you to use data to answer a question of your choice. 
You will likely go through the following steps to complete this project:
1. Select the question you want to answer. Here are the choices:
   * Who will win 2024 presidential election?
   * Will there be an earthquake in West Coast in 2024?

2. Narrow down the scope of your question to a smaller, well-defined question that is easier 
   to answer. For example:
   * Instead of asking which candidate will win, maybe ask which party will win.
   * Instead of trying to give a Y/N answer, maybe try to estimate the probability of it happening
     this year.

3. Gather relevant data
    * Usually we need information from past to help us predict the future. 
    * What historical data on presidential election can you gather? What historical data on 
      earthquakes can you gather? Reach out to people who know these subjects to help you
      find relevant data sources
   
4. Explore your data (exploratory data analysis)
   * Poke around the data for whatever info that interests you
5. Start formulating your hypothesis based on what you see and your instincts
6. How do you prove your hypothesis?
